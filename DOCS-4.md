# Overview (Drone 0.4)

The examples below are for secrets in the 0.4 format and **are not longer maintained** because Drone 0.4 has reached EOL.

The GCP [Service Account JSON](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) must be passed to the `token` parameter in .drone.yml using the `$$SECRET_NAME` notation.

## Basic example of capable of deploying a new version of a Go, PHP and Python 'hello, world' application to standard App Engine.

```yml
deploy:
  gae:
    action: update
    project: my-gae-project
    version: "$$COMMIT"
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
    when:
      event: push
      branch: master
```

## Testing, deploying and migrating traffic to a Go application.

```yml
build:

  test:
    image: jprobinson/ae-go-buildbox:1.6
    commands:
      - goapp get -t
      - goapp test -v -cover
    when:
      event:
        - push
        - pull_request

deploy:

  # deploy new version to App Engine
  gae_new:
    image: nytimes/drone-gae
    environment:
      - GOPATH=/drone
    action: update
    project: my-gae-project
    version: "$$COMMIT"
    ae_environment:
      MY_SECRET: $$MY_SECRET_DEV
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
    when:
      event: push
      branch: master

  # set new version to 'default', which migrates 100% traffic
  gae_migrate:
    image: nytimes/drone-gae
    action: set_default_version
    project: my-gae-project
    version: "$$COMMIT"
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
    when:
      event: push
      branch: master
```

## Deploying multiple applications from the same git repository using the 'dir' option:

```yml
deploy:

  # deploy new version of the 'frontend' service to App Engine
  gae_frontend:
    image: nytimes/drone-gae
    action: update
    project: my-gae-project
    version: "$$COMMIT"
    dir: frontend
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
    when:
      event: push
      branch: master

  # deploy new version of the 'api' service to App Engine
  gae_api:
    image: nytimes/drone-gae
    action: update
    project: my-gae-project
    version: "$$COMMIT"
    dir: api
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
    when:
      event: push
      branch: master
```

## Deploying an application to dev via pushes to master and to prd via git tags:

```yml
deploy:

  # deploy new version of the service to App Engine on
  # every commit to master to a 'dev' project using a specific yaml file
  gae_dev:
    image: nytimes/drone-gae
    action: update
    project: my-dev-project
    version: "$$COMMIT"
    app_file: dev.yaml
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_DEV
    when:
      event: push
      branch: master

  # deploy new version of the service to App Engine on
  # every git tag to a 'prd' project using a specific yaml file
  gae_prd:
    image: nytimes/drone-gae
    action: update
    project: my-prd-project
    version: "$$COMMIT"
    app_file: prd.yaml
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PRD
    when:
      event: tag
```

## Building a Docker image, pushing it to GCR and then deploying it via `gcloud app deploy`:

```yml
build:

  compile:
    image: jprobinson/ae-go-buildbox:1.6
    environment:
      - GOPATH=/drone
    commands:
      - go test -v -race ./...
      - go build -o api .
    when:
      event:
        - push
        - pull_request

publish:

  # runs `docker build` and `docker push` to the specified GCR
  gcr:
    repo: my-gae-project/api
    tag: "$$COMMIT"
    token: >
       $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_DEV
    storage_driver: overlay
    when:
      branch: [develop, master]
      event: push

deploy:

  # deploy a new version using the docker image we just published and stop any previous versions when complete
  gae:
    image: nytimes/drone-gae
    action: deploy
    project: my-gae-project
    flex_image: gcr.io/my-gae-project/puzzles-sub:$$COMMIT
    version: "$${COMMIT:0:10}"
    addl_flags:
     - --stop-previous-version
    token: >
      $$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_LAB
    when:
      event: push
      branch: develop
```
